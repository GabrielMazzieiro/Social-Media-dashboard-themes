# Social media dashboard with theme switcher

![Design preview for the Social media dashboard with theme switcher coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This project is a Frontend Mentor challenge in which I, for the first time, tried to set two themes in a website.

If you liked and wanna do for yourself, check it out at [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io).

**To do this challenge, I needed a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and a tiny bit of JavaScript.**

I'm open to critics and suggestions!

Hope you like how it turned out.
